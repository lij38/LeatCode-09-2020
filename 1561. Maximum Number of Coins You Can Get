//There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

//In each step, you will choose any 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
//Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
//You will pick the next pile with maximum number of coins.
//Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
//Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.
//Given an array of integers piles where piles[i] is the number of coins in the ith pile.

//Return the maximum number of coins which you can have.
